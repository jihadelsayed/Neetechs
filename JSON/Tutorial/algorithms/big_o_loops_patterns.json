      "content": "Welcome back to Neetechs Tutorials. I'm your host, Sayed Jihad Al Sayed. Today we’re breaking down one of the hardest  topics: analyzing runtime of loops. If you can master loop analysis, you unlock Big-O for the rest of your degree. Your teacher LOVES these questions, so let’s crush them."

    {
      "title": "What Is Runtime Analysis? (Wide Shot)",
      "content": "Runtime analysis asks one question: how many times does the loop body execute as the input size n grows? We don’t care about seconds or milliseconds — we care about how the number of iterations scales with n. The key skill is reading loop boundaries and increments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Simple Loop Example (Close Shot + Screen Recording)",
      "content": "Let’s start with a simple loop. This runs n times, so its runtime is O(n).",
      "code": "for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    // constant work\n}"
    },
    {
      "title": "Nested Loop Example (Wide Shot)",
      "content": "Nested loops multiply. If the outer loop runs n times and the inner loop runs n times, the total work is n * n = n².",
      "code": "for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n        // constant work\n    }\n}\n# Runtime: O(n^2)"

      "title": "Triangular Loop Pattern (Close Shot)",

      "title": "Logarithmic Loop: i *= 2 (Wide Shot)",
      "content": "Any loop that multiplies i instead of adding grows logarithmically.",

      "title": "Tricky Loop: i += 3 (Close Shot)",

      "code": "for (i = 0; i < n; i += 3) {\n    // work\n}\n# Still O(n) because constants don't matter"

      "title": "Dependent Loops Example (Wide Shot)",
      "content": "These loops can appear confusing, but total work is what matters.",
      "code": "for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j < i * i; j++) {\n        // work\n    }\n}\n# Total work = sum of i^2 from 1 to n → O(n^3)"

      "title": "Summation Intuition (Close Shot)",
      "content": "You do NOT need formal summation proofs in . You only need intuition:\n- Filling a square grid → O(n^2)\n- Filling a cube grid → O(n^3)\n- Halving steps → O(log n)\n- Nested loops inside halving → O(n log n)"

    {
      "title": "Common Student Mistakes (Wide Shot)",
      "content": "Most students overthink loop analysis. Don’t. The patterns repeat: if the loop shrinks by half, it’s log n. If loops multiply, it’s n² or more. If loops add, it’s n + m. If inner loop depends on i, look for triangular patterns or polynomial growth."

    {
      "title": "Visual Recap (Wide Shot)",
      "content": "Runtime analysis is pattern recognition. Simple loops are linear, nested loops multiply, halving loops are logarithmic, combinations give n log n. Once you see the structure, Big-O becomes easy."
