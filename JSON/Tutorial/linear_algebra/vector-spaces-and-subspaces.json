      "title": "What is a Vector Space?",
      "content": "A vector space is a set of vectors that\u2019s closed under addition and scalar multiplication. That means if you add two vectors or multiply one by a scalar, you're still inside the space."

      "content": "\u211d\u207f is a vector space. So is the set of all polynomials of degree \u2264 n. Even function spaces can be vector spaces. If they follow the 10 vector space rules \u2014 they count."

      "title": "What is a Subspace?",
