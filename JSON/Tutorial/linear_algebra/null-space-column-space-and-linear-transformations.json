      "content": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m Jihad Al Sayed. In this episode, we\u2019re breaking down three powerful ideas: the null space, the column space, and how they connect to linear transformations. This is where theory meets application."

      "title": "What is the Null Space?",
      "content": "The null space of a matrix A is the set of all vectors x that satisfy Ax = 0. It's a subspace of the domain of A and tells us about the solution set to homogeneous systems."
    },
    {
      "title": "What is the Column Space?",
      "content": "The column space is the span of the columns of A. It\u2019s the set of all vectors that A can map to \u2014 in other words, all possible outputs Ax = b."

      "title": "Visual Connection to Transformations",
      "content": "If you think of A as a transformation, the null space is what's collapsed to zero, and the column space is where things end up."
