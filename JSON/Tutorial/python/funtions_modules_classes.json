            "title": "Creating a Class (Close Shot + Screen Recording)",
            "content": "Now, let's take it a step further and talk about something really exciting: classes. Classes are like blueprints for creating objects. For example, we can create a Dog class to represent a dog and its behaviors.",

            "content": "So, kids, remember: functions are like little helpers that do specific jobs, modules are like bookshelves that keep our functions organized, and classes are blueprints for creating objects with properties and behaviors. With these superpowers, you can make your coding journey fun and exciting.\nThat's all for today's tutorial. I hope you enjoyed learning about functions, modules, and classes through our animal examples. Keep practicing, keep exploring, and never stop creating. See you next time on Neetechs Tutorial. Bye for now!"
